Creating a personal website used to be a slow, sometimes overwhelming process. But with the help of Cursor and its built-in LLM assistant, I was able to build and deploy my site far faster than I expected—despite coming from a background using older bundlers.

## Staying Current Without the Overhead

One of the biggest benefits of working with Cursor was how effortlessly it kept me up to date with the modern web development stack. I’d previously used older bundlers like Webpack, but was unfamiliar with newer tools like **Bun** and **Vite**. Instead of digging through docs and scattered tutorials, I simply asked the LLM for quick comparisons, best practices, and step-by-step migration advice. It felt like learning by doing—but on fast-forward.

## Learning Concepts as I Build

Cursor didn't just autocomplete code—it explained concepts in context. Whether I was exploring **React Server Components**, **modern module resolution**, or **optimizing page load performance**, I could ask follow-up questions and get targeted, accurate responses immediately. This made the learning process incredibly fluid and efficient.

## Smoothing Out Layout and Styling

Designing the layout was no longer trial-and-error. I described the kind of responsive UI I wanted—fixed sidebar, adaptive content area, consistent theming—and the LLM helped me scaffold components with clean, semantic code. It even suggested Tailwind tweaks and helped polish the CSS to look great in both light and dark themes.

## Debugging Without the Pain

In the past, debugging meant lots of console logs, Stack Overflow tabs, and frustration. Now, when something broke, I could describe the bug or share a snippet, and the LLM would often pinpoint the issue or suggest ways to log more effectively. This made isolating and fixing problems **significantly faster**.

## Components, Content, and Clarity

I quickly built out key sections of the site—Welcome, Experience, Skills, Blog—using reusable components. Whenever I was stuck on phrasing or copy, the LLM helped draft content that matched the tone I wanted. I could even iterate on writing blog posts like this one without leaving my code editor.

## The Big Picture

Using Cursor felt like having a senior developer and a tutor by my side. It wasn’t just about saving time—it was about learning faster, making fewer mistakes, and staying aligned with where the web is headed.

If you're still building sites the old way or feeling overwhelmed by the speed of front-end innovation, working with an LLM in your editor might just change the game for you like it did for me.
